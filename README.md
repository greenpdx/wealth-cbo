Using CBO's data, , forcast wealth distribution 

I read   <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51846">Trends in Family Wealth, 1989 to 2013</a> published by the Congresional Budget Office in 2016.

I ploted the trend of the top 10% of the population wealth compared everbody else for the next 12 years.
